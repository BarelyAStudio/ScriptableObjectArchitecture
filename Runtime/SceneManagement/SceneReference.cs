    // A wrapper that provides the means to safely serialize Scene Asset References.
    //
    // Internally we serialize an Object to the SceneAsset which only exists at editor time.
    // Any time the object is serialized, we store the path provided by this Asset (assuming it was valid).
    //
    // This means that, come build time, the string path of the scene asset is always already stored, which if 
    // the scene was added to the build settings means it can be loaded.
    //
    // It is up to the user to ensure the scene exists in the build settings so it is loadable at runtime.
    // To help with this, a custom PropertyDrawer displays the scene build settings state.
    //
    //  Known issues:
    // - When reverting back to a prefab which has the asset stored as null, Unity will show the property 
    // as modified despite having just reverted. This only happens on the fist time, and reverting again fix it. 
    // Under the hood the state is still always valid and serialized correctly regardless.
